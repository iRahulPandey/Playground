# **Physics Playground**

An interactive simulation to explore physics concepts through dynamic shapes and forces, built with [p5.js](https://p5js.org/).

## **Overview**

Physics Playground allows users to experiment with physics by interacting with various shapes on a canvas. The simulation demonstrates gravity, collisions, and explosions. Users can toggle different modes and create new objects to see how they interact in a dynamic environment.

## **Features**

- **Dynamic Shapes:**
  - Circles, squares, triangles, and stars with random sizes and masses.
  - Real-time collision detection and response.
  
- **Interactive Controls:**
  - Toggle gravity, energy transfer mode, and wall push effects.
  - Enable visual trails and real-time annotations showing object properties like speed and mass.
  
- **Explosions:**
  - Use the "Big Boom" button to initiate an explosion that can break shapes into smaller pieces.
  
- **Click & Hold Interaction:**
  - Click and hold on the canvas to create new circles. The longer the hold, the larger the circle.

- **Add Random Objects:**
  - Automatically add random objects to the canvas every 30 seconds.
